# R2D2
## Description
This is my collection of code bases for interacting with the R2D2 Sphero droid. The following instructions are entirely based on my personal setup and in no way the "correct" way to do this; it's just simply how I have it working. If you get stuck, open an issue and I'll do my best to help you out.

## Requirements
* [StarWars Sphero Droid](https://sphero.com/pages/legacy-products) (discontinued but you can still buy them on amazon or ebay).
* Python 3.x
* MQTT Broaker
  * _Home Assistant's Mosquitto broker will work or you can run a local instance of mosquitto._
*
